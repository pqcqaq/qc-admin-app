### 1. Account Registration and Management

1.1 User accounts for this Service include administrator accounts and sub-accounts. Among them, administrator accounts should be applied for registration with Lingshun Technology by individual users or enterprise user administrators, and take effect after creating an enterprise. Sub-accounts are registered by individual users themselves, or allocated by enterprise/organization administrators to their employees, and the allocated personnel/employees are the end users. Lingshun Technology issuing administrator accounts to you and/or administrators allocating sub-accounts to you are both considered account registration, and the account issuance/allocation date is the registration date. **Please be sure to immediately change your account password after account registration, regularly reset passwords, and properly store accounts and passwords to ensure account security.**

**1.2 You must provide true, accurate, and legal registration materials and information in accordance with laws and regulations and Lingshun Technology requirements.** You also promise not to impersonate others for registration, not to register for others without permission, not to register accounts in ways that may mislead other users, and not to register with usernames that may infringe on others' rights and interests (including but not limited to suspected trademark rights, reputation rights infringement, etc.). If you violate any of the aforementioned agreements, **Lingshun Technology has the right not to register and reserves the right to terminate this Service; if the account has been registered, Lingshun Technology has the right to take measures including but not limited to requiring corrections within a time limit, suspending use, canceling accounts, etc., and all losses resulting therefrom should be borne by you.** If your information changes, please update the information in your account in time.

Therefore, when applying for or using this Service, please be sure to keep your account safe and ensure that the account you use is legally held by you and you have complete control over its use. If you act on behalf of your enterprise/organization, please ensure that you have obtained corresponding legal authorization in advance and have the right to represent the enterprise/organization in managing the account. Lingshun Technology has the right to require you to provide relevant subject certification materials and authorization documents for you and/or your enterprise/organization. If you fail to keep your account and password safe and cause losses to you, your enterprise/organization, Lingshun Technology or third parties, you should bear full responsibility. You agree that if you discover any illegal use of accounts or security vulnerabilities, you have the obligation to immediately notify Lingshun Technology.

The specific process of account cancellation is subject to the relevant page announcement or other requirements of Lingshun Technology. For sub-accounts, since you are an internal employee or designated person of an enterprise/organization, your account is allocated by the administrator or individual of your enterprise/organization. You can contact the administrator or individual of your enterprise/organization to delete the account from the enterprise, and then cancel the personal account. If the administrator account is cancelled, all sub-accounts will also be deemed cancelled, but the separate cancellation of sub-accounts does not affect the effectiveness of the administrator account. After cancelling the account, Lingshun Technology will stop providing you with corresponding services under the account, and will process account-related content and information by methods including but not limited to deletion and anonymization, except as otherwise provided by laws and regulations. You should operate carefully and pay attention to backup in advance, otherwise you should bear all losses or responsibilities resulting therefrom.**
